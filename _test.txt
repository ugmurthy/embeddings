Let’s say, a particular NBFC has a product like school finance or two-wheeler loan, which we as a bank are not doing, or the segment to which they [business partner] are doing. For example, the bank may feel that gold loan of ₹50,000 ticket size per individual isn’t the same as a ₹2 lakh loan, the latter being the segment that we serve. Or the purpose may also be different. It could be for business, which is what we do, whereas they [NBFCs] could do a personal emergency, and so on. We have successful co-lending partnerships going on at present.
